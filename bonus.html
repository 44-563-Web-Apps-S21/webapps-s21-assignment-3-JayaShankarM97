<h1>The Black Eagle</h1>
<body>
<p> 
    Every SuperHero has a Super-Villain in this world. Ours is no different from that. 
    Here comes the 'Super Archanemesis' - 'The Black Eagle'
    The Black Eagle possesses the power to kick deadly radiation from his tail in a field around himself. Also, he conquers combatants with a magical lasso and he rides a spectacular truck into battle. 
    The Black Eagle can create illusion out of thin air, but this power only lasts one day at a time. 
    Additionally, he has the ability to become camouflaged, however never while performing a series of gestures. 
    The Black Eagle has been known to become incredibly massive and he brawls wielding a lethal whip that also grants an extraordinary ability to regenerate. 
    Additionally, he has the power to block lasers and deflect them against any enemy in sight, but can only do so twice an hour.
