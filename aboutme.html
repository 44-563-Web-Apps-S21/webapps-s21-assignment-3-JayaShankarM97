        The world has never been a better place for human beings. The rise of unemployment, poverty, Racial Discrimination, economic imbalance, etc., has lead to devastating consequences. 
        A school kid who got vexed with these misdeeds has decided to reform the cruel society by taking the responsibility into his own hands. He worked tirelessly and came up with a solution - 'Kill the Bad Guys, Save the World for a Better Tomorrow.' 
        He has got superpowers, with which he can target the bad guys, track them down and kill them. He also got a 'Big Mind' to penetrate any highly secured networks, fetch the data about criminals and unresolved cases and hunt them down to hell. 
        He's got "No Mercy." When a crisis occurs, he will be there for his people to protect them. All they need to do is to 'TAP' a 'BUG' symbol button on smartphones, which will immediately send an emergency signal to our SuperHero "BUG BOY."
