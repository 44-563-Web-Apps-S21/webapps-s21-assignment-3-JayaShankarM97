    <h2>Web Surfing</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Surfing the web</b>, learning new technologies is my favorite hobby/activity during my leisure time.
        It has been my <b>daily routine</b> since I got first introduced to computers and smartphones during high school.
        I always love to do it because I like being nerdy all the time.
